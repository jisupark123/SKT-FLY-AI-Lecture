      "Gartner has tracked generative AI on its Hype Cycle™ for Artificial Intelligence since 2020 (also, generative AI was among our Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2022), and the technology has moved from the Innovation Trigger phase to the Peak of Inflated Expectations. But generative AI only hit mainstream headlines in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of very human-seeming interactions.\n",
      "ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI, became wildly popular overnight and galvanized public attention. (OpenAI’s DALL·E 2 tool similarly generates images from text in a related generative AI innovation.)\n",
      "Gartner sees generative AI becoming a general-purpose technology with an impact similar to that of the steam engine, electricity and the internet. The hype will subside as the reality of implementation sets in, but the impact of generative AI will grow as people and enterprises discover more innovative applications for the technology in daily work and life.\n",
      "FAQ on ChatGPT \n",
      "What are the benefits and applications of generative AI?\n",
      "Foundation models, including generative pretrained transformers (which drives ChatGPT), are among the AI architecture innovations that can be used to automate, augment humans or machines, and autonomously execute business and IT processes. \n",
      "The benefits of generative AI include faster product development, enhanced customer experience and improved employee productivity, but the specifics depend on the use case. End users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve, especially when using a service as is, which has major limitations. Generative AI creates artifacts that can be inaccurate or biased, making human validation essential and potentially limiting the time it saves workers. Gartner recommends connecting use cases to KPIs to ensure that any project either improves operational efficiency or creates net new revenue or better experiences.\n",
      "In a recent Gartner webinar poll of more than 2,500 executives, 38% indicated that customer experience and retention is the primary purpose of their generative AI investments. This was followed by revenue growth (26%), cost optimization (17%) and business continuity (7%).\n",

      "What are the risks of generative AI?\n",
      "The risks associated with generative AI are significant and rapidly evolving. A wide array of threat actors have already used the technology to create “deep fakes” or copies of products, and generate artifacts to support increasingly complex scams.\n",
      "ChatGPT and other tools like it are trained on large amounts of publicly available data. They are not designed to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other copyright laws, so it’s imperative to pay close attention to your enterprises’ uses of the platforms. \n",
      "Oversight risks to monitor include:\n",
      "\t•\tLack of transparency. Generative AI and ChatGPT models are unpredictable, and not even the companies behind them always understand everything about how they work.\n",
      "\t•\tAccuracy. Generative AI systems sometimes produce inaccurate and fabricated answers. Assess all outputs for accuracy, appropriateness and actual usefulness before relying on or publicly distributing information. \n",

      "\t•\tIntellectual property (IP) and copyright. There are currently no verifiable data governance and protection assurances regarding confidential enterprise information. Users should assume that any data or queries they enter into the ChatGPT and its competitors will become public information, and we advise enterprises to put in place controls to avoid inadvertently exposing IP. \n",
      "\t•\tCybersecurity and fraud. Enterprises must prepare for malicious actors’ use of generative AI systems for cyber and fraud attacks, such as those that use deep fakes for social engineering of personnel, and ensure mitigating controls are put in place. Confer with your cyber-insurance provider to verify the degree to which your existing policy covers AI-related breaches.\n",
      "\t•\tSustainability. Generative AI uses significant amounts of electricity. Choose vendors that reduce power consumption and leverage high-quality renewable energy to mitigate the impact on your sustainability goals.\n",

It will impact marketing, design, corporate communications, and training and software engineering by augmenting the supporting processes that span many organizations. For example:\\n\\t•\\tWe believe that by 2025, more than 30% of new drugs and materials will be systematically discovered using generative AI techniques, up from zero today. Generative AI looks promising for the pharmaceutical industry, given the opportunity to reduce costs and time in drug discovery.\\n\\t•\\tWe predict that by 2025, 30% of outbound marketing messages from large organizations will be synthetically generated, up from less than 2% in 2022. Text generators like GPT-3 can already be used to create marketing copy and personalized advertising.\\n\\t•\\tIn the manufacturing, automotive, aerospace and defense industries, generative design can create designs optimized to meet specific goals and constraints, such as performance, materials and manufacturing methods.

Small and midsize enterprises may derive significant business value from the free versions of public, openly hosted applications, such as ChatGPT, or by paying low subscription fees. For example, OpenAI is currently $20 per user per month. However, free and low-cost options come with minimal protection of enterprise data and associated output risks.\\nLarger enterprises and those that desire greater analysis or use of their own enterprise data with higher levels of security and IP and privacy protections will need to invest in a range of custom services. This can include building licensed, customizable and proprietary models with data and machine learning platforms, and will require working with vendors and partners. In this instance, costs can be in the millions of dollars.\\nIt’s also worth noting that generative AI capabilities will increasingly be built into the software products you likely use everyday, like Bing, Office 365, Microsoft 365 Copilot and Google Workspace. This is effectively a “free” tier, though vendors will ultimately pass on costs to customers as part of bundled incremental price increases to their products.'),\n",

They are embedding their generative AI technology into their suite of workplace applications, which will immediately get it in the hands of millions of people.\\n\\t•\\tMicrosoft and OpenAI\\xa0are marching in lockstep. Like Google, Microsoft is embedding generative AI technology into its products, but it has the first-mover advantage and buzz of ChatGPT on its side.\\n\\t•\\tAmazon\\xa0has partnered with\\xa0Hugging Face, which has a number of LLMs available on an open-source basis, to build solutions. Amazon also has Bedrock, which provides access to generative AI on the cloud via AWS, and has announced plans for Titan, a set of two AI models that create text and improve searches and personalization.\\n\\t•\\tIBM\\xa0has multiple foundation models and a strong ability to fine-tune both its and third-party models by injecting data and retraining and employing the model.\\nConversational AI Platforms\\xa0\\nIs this the start of artificial general intelligence (AGI)?\\nIt depends whom you ask. AGI, the ability of machines to match or exceed human intelligence and solve problems they never encountered during training, provokes vigorous debate and a mix of awe and dystopia. AI is certainly becoming more capable and is displaying sometimes surprising emergent behaviors that humans did not program.\\nThe likely path is the evolution of machine intelligence that mimics human intelligence but is ultimately aimed at helping humans solve complex problems. This will require governance, new regulation and the participation of a wide swath of society.')]"
